# Technical Specifications

# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The no-code/low-code workflow automation platform enables business users to create, deploy, and manage automated processes without programming expertise. By providing a visual interface for workflow design and extensive integration capabilities, the platform addresses the growing need for business process automation while reducing technical barriers and implementation costs. The system serves business analysts, operations managers, and department heads who need to streamline operations, while providing IT administrators with enterprise-grade security and control features. Through intelligent automation powered by AI agents and extensive third-party integrations, the platform is expected to reduce manual task overhead by 60% and accelerate process implementation by 80% compared to traditional development approaches.
